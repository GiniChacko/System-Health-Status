# System-Health-Status
The project aims for checking the Linux system health with a shell script. This is a short, lightweight script that gets the necessary information and status like hostname, kernel version, CPU, Uptime, memory/ disk usage using native Linux utilities and doesn't take up much room. The Script uses hostname, uname, arch, uptime, cat, mpstat, ps, df, free, head commands to get system information and cut, grep, awk and sed for text processing. The output of the script is a text file that will be generated in the current directory. A variable is set to provide an email address to which the script can send the report file. Apart from system status, the script will check a predefined threshold for CPU load and filesystem size.
